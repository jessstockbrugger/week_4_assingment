                    <p> Hi!! Welcome to my website! My name is Jessica, and I am a 20-year-old aspiring Media Designer originally from Regina Saskatchewan! I am a very outgoing, spontaneous, charismatic 
                        individual who <b><em>loves</em></b> to be out in nature. Whether it’s skiing, camping, hiking, biking, or playing <em>the best sport ever, <mark>Ultimate Frisbee</mark></em>, I am 
                        there! I have always loved the sport of ultimate as it has a very different atmosphere then most other sports, even at the professional level. I am lucky enough to have played on 
                        teams ranging from low level beer league to winning Silver Medal while representing Canada at <a href="https://www.pauc2019.com/" target="_blank"><abbr title="Pan-American Ultimate Championships">PAUC</abbr></a>. Unfortunately, my ultimate 
                        career was put on pause when I tore my ACL on December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019. A ton on recovery later and I was ready to play again, but COVID had different plans. Eventually, because 
                        there was no Ultimate due to COVID, I decided to go ahead and get reconstructive ACL surgery on December 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020 to begin my 1-year rehab to play Ultimate again. Something that has 
                        helped push me during my recovery is a quote from Olympic Medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee. </p>

                      <p> Being someone who loves to be outside all the time, I find a lot my inspiration for my art comes from nature. I am always pushing myself to be better today then 
                          I was yesterday, and I find getting outside helps with sparking new ideas and helps get the creative juice flowing! Having said that, I am excited to be part of the 
                          <abbr title="Interactive Media Design ">IMD</abbr>. program at Algonquin college. This program will help push me increase the skills I currently have as well as learn new skills such 
                          as coding!! If you are reading this it means I have successfully applied what I have learn't thus far in my Responsive Web Desing course taught by the best prof <abbr title="Travis Gobiel ">ever</abbr>! 
                          I am so excited to see what else I will learn from this course and see where a new life with those skills will take me. I took 2 years off between high school and college to gain 
                          life experience, save money for college and figure out exactly what I wanted to go to school for. I bounced tons of ideas around from construction worker to police officer to interior 
                          designer, and I can honestly say I am so glad I took that time off to learn more about myself and what I love, like, and hate.  I have found myself in a program that combines all 
                          the career goals I have ever wanted into one <em>amazing</em> program that will be more like a hobby then a job at the end of the day. All in all, 
                          I can’t wait to see what life I will create for myself and I can’t wait to meet the person I will become with everything I will learn throughout my life.</p>
